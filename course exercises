# week 4 HLT numpy exercises
1. Create a 1D array of numbers from 0 to 9?

import numpy as np
list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
a = np.array(list)
print(a)

output: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

2.Create a 3×3 NumPy array of all Boolean value Trues?

#3x3 numpy array 
A = np.array([[20, 22, 23], [24, 25, 26], [27, 28, 29]])
print(A > 2)


output: [[ True  True  True]
 [ True  True  True]
 [ True  True  True]]
 
 3. Extract all odd numbers from array of 1-10?
 
 a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,7,8,9])
a[a% 2==1]

output: array([1, 3, 5, 7, 7, 9])
